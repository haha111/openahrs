= openAHRS =

openAHRS is a free open-source Software/Hardware IMU(Inertial Measurement Unit) / AHRS (Attitude Heading Reference System).
Code is released under the GPL v2 license.

= Current functionality =

openAHRS is in beta stage. Software and hardware schematics are available through git or the web interface through github.

----

== Software ==
A 7-state Kalman Filter is implemented, tracking attitude (roll,pitch,yaw) and gyro bias.
There are some demo applications under the test directory which can be run on any platform. The test-kal7 program simulates noisy input data and writes processed information to an octave file.

openAHRS uses the [http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/ eigen2] matrix library.

== AHRS implementations ==

Platform-specific AHRS's are placed inside the AHRSs/ folder. Currently there is an [http://github.com/cbecker/openahrs/wikis/avr32-ahrs AVR32 port] only.
